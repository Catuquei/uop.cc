project i worked on in 2023, made for me and friends. great learning experience and i learned a lot about java and minecraft

mostly original code, this is what's directly lifted:
- oyvey - the base and some modules
- ccshack - instamine & chestswap
- phobos - instantspeed & logspots

also zprestige taught me and sjnez how to make crystalpredict in call one time that was so fun

thanks to dbear, roadman, catuquei, gameingtime & neo2010 for testing, ideas, and motivation

HAVE FUN :D
